# 🛣️ Reddit MCP Server Product Roadmap

> **Transform from read-only research to full Reddit interaction platform**

---

## 🎯 Current State

**Reddit Research MCP Server v0.1.1** - A powerful read-only research tool that turns Reddit into a queryable database with full citations. Currently supports:

- ✅ Semantic subreddit discovery across 20k+ communities
- ✅ Comprehensive post and comment fetching
- ✅ Advanced search with temporal filtering
- ✅ Citation-rich research reports
- ✅ Zero-configuration hosted deployment

**Limitations:** Read-only access, no user authentication, cannot interact with Reddit content.

---

## 🚀 Vision

Evolve into a comprehensive Reddit automation platform where users can authenticate with their accounts, manage communities, monitor content, and interact programmatically—all through the MCP protocol.

---

## 🗺️ Feature Development Path

  - Automatic token refresh handling
  - User session management

#### 🔧 Technical Requirements
- Migrate `src/config.py` from PRAW to async PRAW
- Add OAuth2 endpoints to FastMCP server
- Implement token persistence (SQLite or file-based)
- Update all existing tools to support authenticated requests
- Add authentication status to MCP resources

#### 🔗 Dependencies
- Research existing async PRAW authentication patterns
- Design secure token storage strategy
- Plan user experience for OAuth flow in MCP context

---

### **Phase 3: Monitoring & Rules Engine** 👀
> **Priority: High** • **Status: Not Started** • **Effort: High**

**Goal:** Create intelligent monitoring system for subreddits and multireddits with customizable rules.

#### 🎯 Deliverables
- **Content Monitoring**
  - Monitor specific subreddits or multireddits for new posts
  - Real-time comment monitoring on selected posts
  - Keyword-based content filtering

- **Rule Engine**
  - User-defined rules for content matching
  - Support for regex patterns, keyword lists, user filters
  - Score thresholds and engagement metrics
  - Time-based rules (e.g., "posts from last 24 hours")

- **Notification System**
  - Configurable alerts for matching content
  - Multiple notification channels (webhook, email, MCP events)
  - Rate limiting and deduplication

- **Dashboard Integration**
  - Monitor status through MCP resources
  - Performance metrics and match statistics
  - Rule effectiveness analytics

#### 🔧 Technical Requirements
- Background task system (asyncio or Celery)
- Rule definition DSL or JSON schema
- Persistent storage for rules and monitoring state
- New modules: `src/monitoring/`, `src/rules/`, `src/notifications/`
- MCP tools: `create_monitor`, `manage_rules`, `get_alerts`

#### 🔗 Dependencies
- **Requires:** Phase 1 (Authentication) for personalized monitoring
- **Enhances:** Phase 2 (Multireddit) monitoring capabilities
- **Integrates with:** Existing search and discovery tools

---

### **Phase 4: Content Creation & Interaction** ✏️
> **Priority: Medium** • **Status: Not Started** • **Effort: High**

**Goal:** Enable users to create posts, comments, and interact with Reddit content programmatically.

#### 🎯 Deliverables
- **Post Creation**
  - Submit text posts to specified subreddits
  - Submit link posts with URL validation
  - Support for post scheduling and drafts
  - Template system for common post types

- **Comment Interaction**
  - Reply to posts and comments
  - Edit existing comments and posts
  - Delete user's own content
  - Upvote/downvote functionality

- **Advanced Interactions**
  - Message other Reddit users
  - Manage user's saved posts and comments
  - Follow/unfollow users and subreddits
  - Award posts and comments

- **Content Management**
  - Bulk operations for content management
  - Content analytics and performance tracking
  - Compliance checking for subreddit rules

#### 🔧 Technical Requirements
- New `src/tools/content.py` module
- MCP tools: `create_post`, `reply_comment`, `manage_content`
- Content validation and rule checking
- Rate limiting to comply with Reddit API limits
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

#### 🔗 Dependencies
- **Requires:** Phase 1 (Authentication) for content creation permissions
- **Enhances:** Phase 3 (Monitoring) with automated responses
- **Builds on:** Existing post and comment fetching infrastructure

## 🏗️ Development Notes

### Current Architecture Strengths
- **FastMCP Framework**: Solid foundation for adding new tools
- **Vector Search**: ChromaDB integration for semantic operations
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation in `src/tools/` structure
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive Pydantic models
- **Hosted Deployment**: Zero-friction user setup

### Key Technical Considerations
- **Rate Limiting**: Reddit API has strict limits, especially for write operations
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery for network and API issues
- **Security**: Secure token storage and transmission
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing read-only functionality
- **Performance**: Async operations for concurrent Reddit API calls

### Success Indicators
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Users can authenticate and see their Reddit profile info
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Users can create multireddits with discovered subreddits
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Monitoring system catches relevant content in real-time
- ✅ **Phase 4**: Users can post/comment through MCP without manual intervention
