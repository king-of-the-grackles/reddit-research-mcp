# Reddit API Configuration (Required for hosted server)
# These are only needed if you're contributing to development.
# Regular users connecting to the hosted service don't need these.

REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=RedditMCP/1.0 by u/your_username

# Vector Database Proxy Authentication (Optional)
# The hosted service handles this automatically.
# For development with your own proxy server:
# CHROMA_PROXY_URL=https://your-proxy.com
# CHROMA_PROXY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# WorkOS AuthKit Authentication with DCR (Optional)
# Enable authentication for your FastMCP server using WorkOS AuthKit
# AuthKit uses Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) for seamless MCP client authentication
# To use WorkOS AuthKit:
# 1. Create a WorkOS account at https://workos.com/
# 2. Enable AuthKit in your WorkOS dashboard
# 3. Go to Applications â†’ Configuration and enable "Dynamic Client Registration"
# 4. Copy your AuthKit domain below

# Your WorkOS AuthKit domain (e.g., https://your-app.authkit.app)
# This is the ONLY configuration needed for AuthKit with DCR!
WORKOS_AUTHKIT_DOMAIN=

# Server base URL (defaults to http://localhost:8000 for development)
# For production: https://your-project.fastmcp.app
FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_WORKOS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Note: No client_id or client_secret needed with AuthKit DCR!
# MCP clients will automatically register themselves via Dynamic Client Registration
# No scope configuration needed - AuthKit handles diverse client scopes gracefully

# Transport and port configuration for development
# When auth is enabled, server defaults to HTTP transport
FASTMCP_TRANSPORT=http
FASTMCP_PORT=8000
