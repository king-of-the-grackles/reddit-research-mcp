# Reddit API Configuration (Required for hosted server)
# These are only needed if you're contributing to development.
# Regular users connecting to the hosted service don't need these.

# Vector Database Proxy Authentication (Optional)
# The hosted service handles this automatically.
# For development with your own proxy server:
# CHROMA_PROXY_URL=https://your-proxy.com
# CHROMA_PROXY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# WorkOS Authentication (Optional but recommended)
# FastMCP prefers WorkOS AuthKit with Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) and
# automatically falls back to the OAuth proxy flow when client credentials are provided.
#
# To use AuthKit + DCR (best for MCP compatibility):
# 1. Create a WorkOS account at https://workos.com/
# 2. Enable AuthKit in your WorkOS dashboard
# 3. Go to Applications → Configuration and enable "Dynamic Client Registration"
# 4. Copy your AuthKit domain into WORKOS_AUTHKIT_DOMAIN below

# Your WorkOS AuthKit domain (e.g., https://your-app.authkit.app)
# This is the ONLY configuration needed for AuthKit with DCR. Leave the
# client ID and secret blank and FastMCP will auto-register MCP clients.

# Server base URL (defaults to http://localhost:8000 for development)
# For production: https://your-project.fastmcp.app

# OAuth proxy fallback (WorkOS Connect) – optional
# Uncomment these ONLY if you are using WorkOS Connect without DCR. When
# both an AuthKit domain and client credentials are present, the server will
# choose AuthKit unless you override FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_WORKOS_MODE.

# Transport and port configuration for development
# When auth is enabled, server defaults to HTTP transport
