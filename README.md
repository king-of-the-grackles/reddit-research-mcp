Turn Reddit's chaos into actionable insights. Dialog is your all-in-one Reddit intelligence platform for competitive analysis, market research, and customer discovery across 20,000+ active subreddits.

This is the official MCP server powering [Dialog](https://app.dialog.tools) - the AI-powered Reddit research platform built for indie hackers, SaaS founders, product managers, and market researchers.

---

## Why Dialog?

**Evidence-based insights with full citations.** Every finding links back to real Reddit posts and comments with upvote counts, awards, and direct URLs. When you say "users are complaining about X," you'll have the receipts to prove it.

**Zero-friction setup.** No Reddit API credentials needed. No terminal commands. No credential management. Just connect and start researching.

**Semantic search at scale.** Reddit's API caps at 250 search results. Dialog searches conceptually across 20,000+ indexed subreddits using vector embeddings, finding relevant communities you didn't know existed.

**Persistent research management.** Save subreddit collections into feeds for ongoing monitoring. Perfect for long-term competitive analysis and market research campaigns.

## Technical Details

<details>
<summary><strong>Three-Layer MCP Architecture</strong></summary>

Dialog follows the **layered abstraction pattern** for scalability and self-documentation:

### Layer 1: Discovery
```python
discover_operations()
```
See what operations are available and get workflow recommendations.

### Layer 2: Schema Inspection
```python
get_operation_schema("discover_subreddits", include_examples=True)
```
Understand parameter requirements, validation rules, and see examples before executing.

### Layer 3: Execution
```python
execute_operation("discover_subreddits", {
    "query": "machine learning",
    "limit": 15,
    "min_confidence": 0.6
})
```
Perform the actual operation with validated parameters.
